## Installation 
The initial iteration of the CLI has been designed for developers on macOS, but some commands will work on Windows
 and Linux as well. 

The CLI requires Python3. It is currently distributed on the TestPyPI repository and can be installed with the
 following command: 
 ```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kbk
 ```

To update the CLI:
 ```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kbk --upgrade
 ```

## Usage
Now try running a command:
```
kbk --help
```
